# Factory Method Pattern

A creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the process of creating objects. The factory method encapsulates the instantiation process of an object.
The factory is responsible to instanciate an object and in addition, it allows the programmer who creates the factory method to provide individual, but standardized
ways to create objects.
