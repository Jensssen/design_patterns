# Decorator Pattern

The decorator pattern allows us to change the behaviour of a function, or an object at run time. 

The decorator pattern is basically just applying a wrapper to a function or an object. 

Definition:
- The decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
  Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing before extending functionality.
